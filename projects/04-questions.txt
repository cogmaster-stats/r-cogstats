Using a knitr or Pweave custom report, you are asked to answer the following
questions:

1. (a) Give a numerical summary of FEV1 (mean, standard deviation and range)
   for each smoking category (recoded as a categorical variable with
   appropriate levels), and for all subjects (grand mean and overall
   standard deviation). Results should be printed in one or two Tables. (b)
   Use box-and-whiskers charts or density plots to show the distribution of
   individual values.

2. Carry out a one-way ANOVA to test the null hypothesis that the age at
   breast cancer diagnosis does not depend on genotype. (a) Formulate your
   conclusion in plain English, and (b) report the percentage of explained
   variance.

3. (a) Use post-hoc Tukey HSD tests to compare all pairs of means among the
   four groups of smokers. Summarize point estimates and 95% confidence
   intervals in a Table or graphical display, and indicate which pairs of
   means are found to be significantly different. (b) Compare those results
   with results from all pairwise comparisons for mean FEV1 using the
   Bonferroni method.

4. Is there any evidence for a linear or quadratic trend for mean FEV1 when
   considering smoking status as ordered factor levels: 1 < 2 < 3 < 4?

5. (a) Compare the preceding results with the conclusion that would be
   reached by using a regression approach where one considers smoking status
   as a numerical variable, as well as its square, i.e., using a formula
   like FEV1 ~ smoking + I(smoking)^2. (b) What could explain the
   difference, if any?
