## Research question

In this study, researchers were interested in perspective or role taking in
young children in relation with daycare experience. A total of 40 children,
aged 2 to 5 years, were subjected to a battery of tests on perspective
taking (e.g., a card-stimulus with different pictures on each face was
placed between the subject and the experimenter, and the subject had to
guess what the experimenter was actually seeing). Subjects were allocated to
two groups: those who had extensive daycare experience, and those who had no
daycare experience. A second experimental factor was the age of the
children (2 groups): 2-3 years and 4-5 years. The response variable is a
composite score derived from Factor Analysis of performance on role taking
tasks, with higher scores indicating better performance.

The main questions are:

1. Does daycare experience improve overall performance on perspective
   taking?
2. Is this result influenced by the age of the subject?


## Loading data in R or Python

Individual data are available in the file 05-role.dat. Instructions to load
this data set in R are given below. Note that categorical predictors are
stored as integers, with the following convention:

- 1st column, daycare experience: 1 = no daycare experience, 2 = daycare
  experience
- 2nd column, age group: 1 = younger, 2 = older 

> r <- read.table("05-role.dat", header=FALSE)
> names(r)
[1] "V1" "V2" "V3"
> str(r)
'data.frame':	40 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ V1: int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ V2: int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ V3: num  -0.139 -2.002 -1.631 -2.173 0.179 ...

Note that there are no variable names, so it might be convenient to add some
relevant names.

Using Python, with a working installation of Pandas, you can use the
following instructions:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> r = pd.read_table("05-role.dat", header=None, sep='\s+')
>>> r.head()
   0  1      2
0  1  1 -0.139
1  1  1 -2.002
2  1  1 -1.631
3  1  1 -2.173
4  1  1  0.179
